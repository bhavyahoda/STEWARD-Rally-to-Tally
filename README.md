# Problems 
Companies manufacturing, processing, and selling steel pipes have to store these huge pipes in large outside yards. As a result, they face many difficulties in inventory management. These difficulties majorly include:
1. Counting the number of pipes in a particular stack in the inventory
2. Inability to automate the counting process and dependency on manual labor leads increase in cost
3. Keeping a live record of pipe data like count, material, diameter location in inventory, etc. 

# Solution
A generic ROS based rover stack which is capable of going to periodic pipe counting missions. Rover will be equipped with sensors like a camera, GPS, etc. that will be used for all the labor-intensive tasks like going in the field and counting. 
Rover has a computer vision algorithm deployed that will be used to calculate the number of pipes in a stack using the cameraâ€™s video stream. Rover is also responsible to publish useful
information on Grafana dashboards like:

1. Count
2. Pipe manufacturing type, outside diameter and material
3. Rover health stats like current drawn, charge estimate, power monitoring, etc.

# Technologies used
1. ROS
2. OpenCV
3. Python
4. Influx DB
5. Grafana

# Highlighting features

1. The solution is highly customised as it uses ROS stack due to which it easy to port to any autonomous solution. This makes our rover stack a plugin like entity that can be
deployed to any autonomous solution including Rovers, drones etc.
2. An intuitive dashboard which increases observability about:
   1. Count of pipes for each rover mission
   2. Pipe material, manufacturing type & diameter
   3. Rover Stats like current drawn, battery 
3. Separation of concerns between rover stack, computer vision and dashboards which makes our solution modular and customizable.
